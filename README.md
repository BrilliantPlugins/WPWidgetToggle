WP Widget Toggle

WordPress.org Plugin Repo:
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-widget-toggle/

Hides widget content on page load then allows the user to toggle widgets open and closed by clicking the widget title.

Inspired by this MSP WP thread:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mpls-stpaul-wordpress/jzqcYebwD3s

There are no plugin options, yet.

Fork it and tweak to your needs... or hire me to make you a custom version:
